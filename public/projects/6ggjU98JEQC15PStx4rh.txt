# ChargePoint Fleet Enterprise Software

Part of ChargePoint's next-generation enterprise software suite, this project focused on designing a fleet management system for real-time charging activity. The design enables users to track multiple depot overviews and dive into specific depot details efficiently.

## Problem

Public transit agencies aimed to electrify their bus fleets and partnered with ChargePoint for charging solutions. However, the initial enterprise fleet software lacked effective delivery of critical information, requiring significant improvements.

## Screenshots from the Existing Software

- ![All Depots Overview Page: This page was intended to provide a high-level view of charging activities across multiple depots. However, it overemphasized less critical details, like depot locations with map thumbnails, instead of prioritizing real-time charging data.](/content/writing/6ggjU98JEQC15PStx4rh-2.png)
- ![Charging Activity Data Table: The existing product separates charging activity and dispatch information into different pages, forcing users to toggle between them to assess daily operations and potential risks.](/content/writing/6ggjU98JEQC15PStx4rh-3.png)
- ![Dispatch Data Table: The text-heavy format makes it difficult to quickly identify at-risk vehicles, requiring users to read each entry line by line.](/content/writing/6ggjU98JEQC15PStx4rh-4.png)

## Design Iterations: All Depots Overview Page

- ![Design Round 1: Real-Time Charging Focus – This design displays current charging vehicles and total power usage but struggles with scalability. While effective for small operations (under 50 vehicles), relying on raw data numbers makes it challenging to accommodate larger fleets of 100+ vehicles.](/content/writing/6ggjU98JEQC15PStx4rh-5.png)
- ![Design Round 2: Enhanced with Percentage-Based Charging Data – This iteration incorporates raw figures while emphasizing percentage-based charging status. However, its text-heavy, number-centric design slows down data processing for users.](/content/writing/6ggjU98JEQC15PStx4rh-6.png)
- ![Final Design: This design successfully provides an at-a-glance overview of each depot's charging activity. A donut chart for vehicle charging status and a bar graph for total power usage effectively convey key information.](/content/writing/6ggjU98JEQC15PStx4rh-7.png)

## Final Design: All Depots Overview Page

In addition to overview cards for each depot, the design now includes a right-column feature that displays active incident data from individual vehicles, ensuring urgent alerts are easily accessible. 

In Focus: Color Coding – To help depot managers quickly identify severe issues, vivid red highlights critical concerns, while muted tones distinguish other statuses.

## Design Iterations: Single Depot Detail Page

- ![Design Round 1: Enhanced the vehicle charging data table by adding block/route assignment data to improve awareness of operational risks. However, the design remained text-heavy, lacking quick, insightful visualization.](/content/writing/6ggjU98JEQC15PStx4rh-9.png)
- ![Design Round 2: Combined charging session data with vehicle block assignments in a time series graph, using bar charts for clearer insights than traditional tables. A donut chart at the top summarizes vehicle statuses, offering an immediate, comprehensive overview.](/content/writing/6ggjU98JEQC15PStx4rh-10.png)
- ![Final Design: Applied status colors to bar graphs for better differentiation and refined the visuals for a cleaner, more organized look.](/content/writing/6ggjU98JEQC15PStx4rh-11.png)
- ![Close-up: Clicking a bar graph expands it into a popover, revealing additional details for deeper insights.](/content/writing/6ggjU98JEQC15PStx4rh-12.png)

## My Contributions

As the solo designer in the fleet pod, I led brainstorming sessions with cross-functional teams and guided the design process from low-fidelity sketches to refined solutions through multiple iterations. My contributions were instrumental in streamlining product and design decisions.

In collaboration with the design system team, I helped develop the strategic use of color coding in data visualization.
