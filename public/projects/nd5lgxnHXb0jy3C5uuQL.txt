# Designing ChargePoint Self-Serve Onboarding for Charging Station Activation

The legacy ChargePoint enterprise software's manual station provisioning process hindered scalability. A significant business process overhaul was crucial for rapid station onboarding and achieving a 10x growth.

## Pain Analysis of Today's Customer Journey

Today's customer onboarding at ChargePoint is entirely manual, irrespective of the volume of purchase. While a personalized, white-glove service is appropriate for large customers with complex requirements and numerous charging stations, a streamlined, self-service provisioning process could significantly benefit smaller customers purchasing fewer than 5 stations with straightforward use cases. Implementing this approach can accelerate ChargePoint's business growth.

## Design Goal: Get new stations up and running as soon as possible

1. Create a digital self service tool that customers(not CP agents) use to setup org account and provision stations

2. Recommend settings vs Make customers create from scratch

3. Modular onboarding flows: SW only, SW-HW\
   decouple each task: \
   \- adding additional user role from creating account\
   \- entering bank account from station activation

4. Customer support engages only on unique or advanced setting\
   Inline education on user roles and station policies

## My Contribution

I collaborated with a UX researcher on this project. Based on the internal stakeholder interviews(PMs, Onboarding/Renewal Team), we analyzed today's pain points through out onboarding journey. Following this, we envisioned a more seamless onboarding experience for the future. This led to multiple rounds of paper prototype iterations to refine our concepts.\

The project was well-received by the previous company leadership, but a change in management and limited engineering resources stalled its progress to further design and development stages.
