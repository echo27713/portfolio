# Designing ChargePoint Self-Serve Onboarding for Seamless Charging Station Activation

The manual station provisioning process in ChargePoint’s legacy enterprise software limited scalability. A major overhaul was essential to enable rapid onboarding and support 10x growth.

## Pain Point Analysis of the Current Customer Journey

ChargePoint’s current customer onboarding process is entirely manual, regardless of purchase volume. While a personalized, white-glove service suits large customers with complex needs, a streamlined self-service provisioning process would greatly benefit smaller customers with fewer than five stations and straightforward use cases. This shift could accelerate ChargePoint’s business growth.

## Design Goal: Get new stations up and running as soon as possible

Here is a new design approach: Empowering Customers with a Digital Self-Service Onboarding Tool

**Customer-Driven Setup**: Shift the onboarding process from CP agents to customers, enabling them to set up their organization account and provision stations independently.

**Guided Experience**: Provide recommended settings to streamline onboarding, reducing the need for customers to configure everything from scratch. 

**Modular Onboarding Flows**: Support both software-only and software-hardware setups while decoupling key tasks, such as: Adding user roles separately from account creation./ Entering bank account details independently from station activation.

**Targeted Customer Support**: Engage support only for unique or advanced settings, minimizing agent intervention.

**Inline Education**: Integrate contextual guidance on user roles and station policies to assist customers throughout the process.

## My Contribution

I collaborated with a UX researcher to analyze onboarding pain points through internal stakeholder interviews with PMs and the Onboarding/Renewal team. Together, we mapped the current onboarding journey and identified key areas for improvement.

Building on these insights, we envisioned a more seamless future onboarding experience, iterating through multiple rounds of paper prototypes to refine our concepts.

The project was well-received by company leadership at the time, but progress stalled due to a management change and limited engineering resources..
